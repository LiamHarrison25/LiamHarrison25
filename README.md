## About

Gameplay developer, nominated for best technical in the 2024 Ubisoft Game Lab Competition, from Champlain College.

I am passionate about video games and am interested in pursuing a career in game development. Working on video games has been a life long dream of mine. Ever since I started playing games when I was younger, I have always been interested in creating things I can call my own. From making custom Redstone machines in Minecraft, to messing around with forge in Halo, I have always enjoyed the creativity that can be brought out through video games. 

My most important skills are problem-solving and adaptability. These have helped me throughout my time programming at my time in college. I am a passionate bug solver, and I thrive on challenges. I can adapt very quickly to change, which I believe just provides more problems for me to help solve.
